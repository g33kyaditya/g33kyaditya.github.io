      <description>Wow ! What a summer !
Roughly 12 weeks have passed since I started working on KDE Now (well formally). Results came out some couple of hours ago and I passed the full term evaluation. In this post, I&amp;#8217;m going to talk about what I&amp;#8217;m planning for the future of KDE Now. How the past weeks have been and some other stuff.
&amp;nbsp;
To start with, the summer was awesome. I got to learn so much and that certainly made me a better programmer.</description>

      <description>Hey ! I’m making KDE Now, an application for the Plasma Desktop. It would help the user see important stuff from his email, on a plasmoid. It’s similar to what Google Now does on Android. To know more, click here.
&amp;nbsp;
Roughly three weeks have passed since I last blogged about my project. School started and it was tough finding time for everything let alone blogging. This year&amp;#8217;s Summer of Code is reaching it&amp;#8217;s end and I have much to talk about this time around.</description>

Another week has passed. And I&amp;#8217;m back with more updates of what I&amp;#8217;ve done over last week. I worked on the plasmoid side of things this time. Andres(Andy) Betts at the KDE-VDG was very generous and had given me some nice mockups for Event and Hotel cards.</description>

Another week has passed since I last posted about my progress. This week I did more work primarily on the plasmoid side of things.
I added receivers for the data, that was being thrown over D-Bus.</description>

I know, I know. I haven&amp;#8217;t blogged for a while. But the past couple of weeks have been busy. Not just in terms of my project, but also my personal life, with a lot of things happening lately that demand my attention.</description>

In the past week, I worked on the code reviews I got. Hence, I changed the classes&amp;#8217; design all over. The way it works now, is that there is a central dispatcher, the daemon, that handles all the jobs.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s been some time since the coding period started for this year&amp;#8217;s Summer of Code. I had exams till 27th of May, so I started from 28th. My mentor knew about it already, so things went buttery smooth.</description>

Just an update on what I&amp;#8217;ve planned for the coming weeks. Also, I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ll be able to do anything else for the next two weeks, since my final semester exams start from 18th of this month, and last till 28th.</description>

As I said, in my last post, I am one of the student developers for KDE this year during this Google Summer of Code. I&amp;#8217;ll be working on a project related to Plasma.</description>

      <description>Hey all !
I am happy to let you know that I got into Google Summer of Code this year. I&amp;#8217;ll be working with KDE to create an application, KDE Now. I&amp;#8217;ll go more into details as I move forward with it.
KDE Now would be a desktop application similar to Google Now cards for Android. It would show relevant and useful information to the user from his Email. Stuff like, his Flight Reservation or Hotel details would be shown in the form of concise cards.</description>

      <description>Well, I agree it&amp;#8217;s a bit late now. But, I checked my Season of KDE project status just now and was glad to know that I had passed. So, this post goes to it. My previous posts on SoK with PMC can be found here .
Working on PMC was a really good experience. For someone like me, who takes time to get the hang of things, I really enjoyed all that I learnt during the past four months.</description>

      <description>A very Happy New Year fellas ! Last time I said, that I&amp;#8217;d be working on Bhushan&amp;#8217;s new UI branch. This post is about it. He started working on it as part of his GSoC. I took the work of finishing it and merging it into master. However, my work&amp;#8217;s still not fully done. So I am for now just working on my branch. I will merge it into master later.</description>

      <description>December was a particularly hectic month. I had my semester exams so could not make time for this project. It was only after 20th of the month that I was back into it.
Anyways, like I said, I implemented the lastfm image fetcher as a plugin. It has an added advantage that you could turn it off if you want to. It&amp;#8217;s compiled as a different component, and on runtime acts independently of the main application.</description>

      <description>Welcome my readers. This one&amp;#8217;s going to be about PMC so you can skip right away if you are not interested in the technicalities.
PMC is a &amp;#8216;Media Center&amp;#8217; in essence. A one stop solution for music,pictures and videos. It was recently ported to Qt5/KF5. It&amp;#8217;s based on Model View Controller Concept and its UI is in QML with the complete backend in C++ and Qt.
My aim is to &amp;#8216;Improve it&amp;#8217;s Architecture&amp;#8217; .</description>

      <description>Hello people . Back with another post. This time about Season of KDE . For those who don&amp;#8217;t know, SoK is a Google Summer of Code SpinOff in which students work on a project for an open source organization directly under the guidance of a seaoned mentor.
I got selected for my proposed idea of improving the Plasma Media Center Architecture. To be precise, it&amp;#8217;s not just one task but a collection of tasks that I&amp;#8217;ll be doing through my SoK period.</description>
