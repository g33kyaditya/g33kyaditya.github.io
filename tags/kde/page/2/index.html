						<div class="post-summary"><p>Hey all !
I am happy to let you know that I got into Google Summer of Code this year. I&#8217;ll be working with KDE to create an application, KDE Now. I&#8217;ll go more into details as I move forward with it.
KDE Now would be a desktop application similar to Google Now cards for Android. It would show relevant and useful information to the user from his Email. Stuff like, his Flight Reservation or Hotel details would be shown in the form of concise cards.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Well, I agree it&#8217;s a bit late now. But, I checked my Season of KDE project status just now and was glad to know that I had passed. So, this post goes to it. My previous posts on SoK with PMC can be found here .
Working on PMC was a really good experience. For someone like me, who takes time to get the hang of things, I really enjoyed all that I learnt during the past four months.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>A very Happy New Year fellas ! Last time I said, that I&#8217;d be working on Bhushan&#8217;s new UI branch. This post is about it. He started working on it as part of his GSoC. I took the work of finishing it and merging it into master. However, my work&#8217;s still not fully done. So I am for now just working on my branch. I will merge it into master later.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>December was a particularly hectic month. I had my semester exams so could not make time for this project. It was only after 20th of the month that I was back into it.
Anyways, like I said, I implemented the lastfm image fetcher as a plugin. It has an added advantage that you could turn it off if you want to. It&#8217;s compiled as a different component, and on runtime acts independently of the main application.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Welcome my readers. This one&#8217;s going to be about PMC so you can skip right away if you are not interested in the technicalities.
PMC is a &#8216;Media Center&#8217; in essence. A one stop solution for music,pictures and videos. It was recently ported to Qt5/KF5. It&#8217;s based on Model View Controller Concept and its UI is in QML with the complete backend in C++ and Qt.
My aim is to &#8216;Improve it&#8217;s Architecture&#8217; .</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Nov 12, 2015</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Hello people . Back with another post. This time about Season of KDE . For those who don&#8217;t know, SoK is a Google Summer of Code SpinOff in which students work on a project for an open source organization directly under the guidance of a seaoned mentor.
I got selected for my proposed idea of improving the Plasma Media Center Architecture. To be precise, it&#8217;s not just one task but a collection of tasks that I&#8217;ll be doing through my SoK period.</p></div>
