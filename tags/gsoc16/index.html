						<div class="post-summary"><p>Wow ! What a summer !
Roughly 12 weeks have passed since I started working on KDE Now (well formally). Results came out some couple of hours ago and I passed the full term evaluation. In this post, I&#8217;m going to talk about what I&#8217;m planning for the future of KDE Now. How the past weeks have been and some other stuff.
&nbsp;
To start with, the summer was awesome. I got to learn so much and that certainly made me a better programmer.</p></div>

Roughly three weeks have passed since I last blogged about my project. School started and it was tough finding time for everything let alone blogging. This year&#8217;s Summer of Code is reaching it&#8217;s end and I have much to talk about this time around.</p></div>

Time sure passes fast when you are enjoying something. And so, another week has passed and I&#8217;m back with another status update. Things look very very good from here on.</p></div>

Another week has passed. And I&#8217;m back with more updates of what I&#8217;ve done over last week. I worked on the plasmoid side of things this time. Andres(Andy) Betts at the KDE-VDG was very generous and had given me some nice mockups for Event and Hotel cards.</p></div>

Another week has passed since I last posted about my progress. This week I did more work primarily on the plasmoid side of things.
I added receivers for the data, that was being thrown over D-Bus.</p></div>

I know, I know. I haven&#8217;t blogged for a while. But the past couple of weeks have been busy. Not just in terms of my project, but also my personal life, with a lot of things happening lately that demand my attention.</p></div>

In the past week, I worked on the code reviews I got. Hence, I changed the classes&#8217; design all over. The way it works now, is that there is a central dispatcher, the daemon, that handles all the jobs.</p></div>

It&#8217;s been some time since the coding period started for this year&#8217;s Summer of Code. I had exams till 27th of May, so I started from 28th. My mentor knew about it already, so things went buttery smooth.</p></div>

Just an update on what I&#8217;ve planned for the coming weeks. Also, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to do anything else for the next two weeks, since my final semester exams start from 18th of this month, and last till 28th.</p></div>

As I said, in my last post, I am one of the student developers for KDE this year during this Google Summer of Code. I&#8217;ll be working on a project related to Plasma.</p></div>
