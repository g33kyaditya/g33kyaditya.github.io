Just an update on what I&#8217;ve planned for the coming weeks. Also, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to do anything else for the next two weeks, since my final semester exams start from 18th of this month, and last till 28th.</p></div>

As I said, in my last post, I am one of the student developers for KDE this year during this Google Summer of Code. I&#8217;ll be working on a project related to Plasma.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Hey all !
I am happy to let you know that I got into Google Summer of Code this year. I&#8217;ll be working with KDE to create an application, KDE Now. I&#8217;ll go more into details as I move forward with it.
KDE Now would be a desktop application similar to Google Now cards for Android. It would show relevant and useful information to the user from his Email. Stuff like, his Flight Reservation or Hotel details would be shown in the form of concise cards.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Well, I am currently at my home. (Again !). Perks of living in a hostel 40 miles from your home, I guess. It&#8217;s holiday time. I have the same 9 days leave that I had during Holi. I still have a couple of days until college reopens.
All I did in this time was drool over the new Game of Thrones season, practice Data Structure and Algorithmic Questions from SPOJ and well, wake up at 12 in the day.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Hey there !
You must have already noticed that I changed the site&#8217;s domain. This looks better to me. The month has been good till now. I am currently at home due to Holi holidays. Holi is an Indian festival in which people play with colors. There&#8217;s a whole story behind why it&#8217;s celebrated but I won&#8217;t go there. This is what it looks like.
I&#8217;ve never really played Holi that much.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Well, I agree it&#8217;s a bit late now. But, I checked my Season of KDE project status just now and was glad to know that I had passed. So, this post goes to it. My previous posts on SoK with PMC can be found here .
Working on PMC was a really good experience. For someone like me, who takes time to get the hang of things, I really enjoyed all that I learnt during the past four months.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>A very Happy New Year fellas ! Last time I said, that I&#8217;d be working on Bhushan&#8217;s new UI branch. This post is about it. He started working on it as part of his GSoC. I took the work of finishing it and merging it into master. However, my work&#8217;s still not fully done. So I am for now just working on my branch. I will merge it into master later.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>December was a particularly hectic month. I had my semester exams so could not make time for this project. It was only after 20th of the month that I was back into it.
Anyways, like I said, I implemented the lastfm image fetcher as a plugin. It has an added advantage that you could turn it off if you want to. It&#8217;s compiled as a different component, and on runtime acts independently of the main application.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Welcome my readers. This one&#8217;s going to be about PMC so you can skip right away if you are not interested in the technicalities.
PMC is a &#8216;Media Center&#8217; in essence. A one stop solution for music,pictures and videos. It was recently ported to Qt5/KF5. It&#8217;s based on Model View Controller Concept and its UI is in QML with the complete backend in C++ and Qt.
My aim is to &#8216;Improve it&#8217;s Architecture&#8217; .</p></div>
