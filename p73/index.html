			<p>Welcome my fellow readers !</p>

<p>As you would have seen, I changed the UI of the blog. This looks much more visually appealing. Its been a long time since my last post. It&#8217;s not easy being a blogger. This makes me wonder how do regular bloggers not run out of topics to write ! *sigh* So here goes.</p>

<p>Life&#8217;s going well. The first fifteen days of September were a complete mess due to some personal issues but everything is back on track. It seems like I am starting out with a new phase in life. Let&#8217;s see what it has to offer.</p>

<p>As for University, things don&#8217;t quite move smoothly. Had my Minors some time back. And I sucked. Well, I didn&#8217;t study for it either but that&#8217;s no excuse. Will score better next time.</p>

<p>As for FOSS, I have news. I am currently working on porting Amarok to Qt5/KF5. More on it in some later post I guess. And I&#8217;m too lazy now to dive into it&#8217;s technicalities. But yeah, everything seems to be going pretty fine. I also got a KDE Developer Account ðŸ™‚ . But as the Ksysadmins say, with great power comes great responsibility. Hahaha</p>

<p>In the midst of it all, I learned shell scripting. And believe me, it&#8217;s awesome. Daily tasks like sorting files or renaming a batch of files based on some parameters is a cakewalk , that would perhaps be a nightmare using GUI. I&#8217;ll continue to use it and read about it as much as I can. Also, earlier I used to compile my C++ programs using &#8211;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>g++ <name of file.cpp> -o <name of file></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this does, is that passes the name of the file you want to compile as an argument to g++. We are using the -o flag and then the <name of file> , so after compilation , the file is saved as <name of file> , without the .cpp extension.</p>

<p>I created a 2 line script for it called &#8221; x &#8221; Â , so that all I have to do now is &#8211;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x <name of file.cpp></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does the same thing as earlier and saves the compiled binary. Here&#8217;s the script in case you want it Â :Â <a href="https://github.com/g33kyaditya/Scripts/blob/master/x">x</a></p>

<p>Also, I finally found a stable build &#8211; Fedora 22 with KDE Plasma 5 . There is still an issue with the login manager (SDDM) , but nothing I cannot find a workaround with CLI . So, that&#8217;s not so much as a problem now.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>

<p>Thanks for Reading</p>
