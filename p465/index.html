                <p>Hey ! I&#8217;m making KDE Now, an application for the Plasma Desktop. It would help the user see important stuff from his email, on a plasmoid. It&#8217;s similar to what Google Now does on Android. To know more, clickÂ <a href="https://g33kyaditya.wordpress.com/2016/04/23/21-google-summer-of-code-2016/">here</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the past week, I worked on the code reviews I got. Hence, I changed the classes&#8217; design all over. The way it works now, is that there is a central dispatcher, theÂ <a href="https://github.com/g33kyaditya/KDE-Now/blob/master/src/daemon.h">daemon</a>, that handles all the jobs. I chose this design, since it was how originally KIMAP jobs, was supposed to be managed. My mentor and Daniel Vratil helped me in deciding this.</p>

<p>I previously said, that I&#8217;d change the update to a new thread. That might not have been entirely true ðŸ˜‰ . From what I know, IDLE is an async process, so there might be some actual lag there. I&#8217;ll add this in my TODO during the time I test everything and just move to other things on my list.</p>

<p>The IMAP client was looking good, so I startedÂ to implement a parser. Now I must say, this took more time than I expected. I was adamant at using Qt JSON library which is pretty good for parsing JSON. But to parse that JSON, the first thing is that IÂ <strong>need</strong> JSON data. I looked through theÂ <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Handling_HTML">docs</a>. Nothing seemed good enough. QtWebKit seemed overkill. Of course, me and my mentor were against using it. There&#8217;s no GUI in our application, and using it would have been a waste of precious resources. I checked some other 3&#8217;rd party C++ libraries like SGML for Qt, Gumbo Parser by Google but nothing seemed appropriate. SGML was a bit (well more) on the slower side. Gumbo seemed good at first, but since it was 3rd party, I was worried. Maybe some things about license too. I didn&#8217;t feel like adding a dependency. Finally I settled for regex (No Wait. Whattt ? I know ? Before you all charge at me, I <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> use it). Yeah, so I settled for regex. I contacted my mentor and Dan, and they were against it (Well me too, but what choice did I have ?). To those of you, who still think, it would have been okay to use regexes, readÂ <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags">this</a>. Dan told me to use QXmlStreamReader. My initial reaction was whattt ? How can I parse HTML with an XML parser ? Hence I never even googled about it. On a second thought though, HTML if formatted nicely, is just plain XML. (Now do you get it ? Just the tags !). I tested it with my IMAP client. Everything seemed good. It&#8217;s <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qxmlstreamreader.html">fast</a>Â and reliable. It&#8217;s also in the QtCore module. So, Speed; check. Reliability; check. No added dependencies;check. What else could I have asked for (A tank ?). So, now I had data between those script tags in HTML, after I parsed it through QXmlStreamReader. Next I parsed this data using Qt JSON Library (<a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qjsondocument.html">QJsonDocument</a>, <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qjsonarray.html">QJsonArray</a>,Â <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qjsonobject.html">QJsonObject</a>). I store the required data in Maps. With the power and consistency of QVariant(Map) things became quite easy.</p>

<p>I got code reviews from my mentor. We discussed some stuff for the next stages.In the next part, I&#8217;ll perfect the extractors I have written. Implement them as plugins and load these plugins in the client. This will make writing extractors for other schemas and hence adding support very easy. I&#8217;ll also be working with a database (SQLite) to cache the fetched emails. One of the things, I noticed just now, is that I&#8217;m using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model">Incremental</a>Â methodology of Software Engineering. I am adding new features one by one. Building and testing at each step. Never thought, I&#8217;d see the impact of the course classes this early ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>See you later.</p>
