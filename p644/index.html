                <p>Hey ! I’m making KDE Now, an application for the Plasma Desktop. It would help the user see important stuff from his email, on a plasmoid. It’s similar to what Google Now does on Android. To know more, click <a href="https://g33kyaditya.wordpress.com/2016/04/23/21-google-summer-of-code-2016/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Time sure passes fast when you are enjoying something. And so, another week has passed and I&#8217;m back with another status update. Things look very very good from here on. At least, not until we decide to change something drastic that I hadn&#8217;t proposed earlier XD.</p>

<p>Last week was rough. I was struggling with viral fever and throat infection for the better part of the week. Plus I had some other things to attend to. Nonetheless, I managed to devote the needed time on my project. I managed to create the UI of the Flight and Restaurant cards. They look good and work as expected (the dynamically loading up of things and all)</p>

<p>Here are the obligatory screenshots</p>

<p>Other than that, I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have much to talk about. I still have not made the Database fix I had talked about in my earlier post. But I&#8217;ll do it next.If you look at it, then in a way I have managed to successfully deliver what all I had planned initially in my proposal :). This was a real confidence boost.</p>

<p>For the next few weeks, I plan to work on some tidbits I had left earlier (like the Database thingy I mentioned). I also might refine the UI. Plus, I also need to figure out a convenient way to make the plasmoid available for the end user in terms of his email credentials. I might look into KWallet but me and my mentor have to still talk about it.</p>

<p>Ending it with a request: If you are a graphics designer and have experience with making vector graphic images and want to help me out, feel free to contact me. Just comment your email id below (it&#8217;s private and I moderate comments :)) and I&#8217;ll contact you. I could really use your help.</p>

<p>Till next time</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
