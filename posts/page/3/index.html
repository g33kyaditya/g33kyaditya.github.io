							<h4 class="post-date">Nov 12, 2015</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Hello people . Back with another post. This time about Season of KDE . For those who don&#8217;t know, SoK is a Google Summer of Code SpinOff in which students work on a project for an open source organization directly under the guidance of a seaoned mentor.
I got selected for my proposed idea of improving the Plasma Media Center Architecture. To be precise, it&#8217;s not just one task but a collection of tasks that I&#8217;ll be doing through my SoK period.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Welcome my fellow readers !
As you would have seen, I changed the UI of the blog. This looks much more visually appealing. Its been a long time since my last post. It&#8217;s not easy being a blogger. This makes me wonder how do regular bloggers not run out of topics to write ! *sigh* So here goes.
Life&#8217;s going well. The first fifteen days of September were a complete mess due to some personal issues but everything is back on track.</p></div>

University Elections are taking place. This time a bit earlier though. All parties have pulled up their socks and are campaigning vigorously. They wake you up at 3 in the morning.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Hey Guys !
Nothing fancy this time. But it seems I am stuck with a problem every week. As if last weekend wasn&#8217;t hectic enough. Last night all was fine. I did what I did and shut down my laptop. All good ! Or so it would seem.
My WiFi stopped working. I also have a Windows 7 on a separate partition. I logged into it. And the WiFi was working.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>So, I&#8217;m gonna be blogging at a stretch for a day or two. I still can&#8217;t figure out why. Anyways, I am now a Sophomore. It feels good to be. At the same time it&#8217;s freaking me out a bit. I just joined College some time back. There&#8217;s so much to do. But I&#8217;ll calm down in some time.
I pretty much spent my summer vacation on my laptop. Hahah. I watched 5 seasons of Breaking Bad.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Writing a blog post after sometime now. Well don&#8217;t give me those looks ! duh !
Had my Minors from , If I remember correctly , Dec 08. Not that I study too much for it. Just didn&#8217;t get the time. Also, I am having my semesters now. Already gave two examinations, out which Calculus went awful. Why do they even include these subjects in our course syllabus. Vectors and Algebra were understandable from CS view, but why Calculus ?</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Nov 6, 2014</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>In the last PULUG session they taught us how to Dual Boot Windows with Linux. Still, I see many of my classmates messing up their systems. One of them had to do a clean installation of Mint 17 (Cinnamon) after literally destroying both his Windows and Mint bootloaders. Ofcourse, he lost all his movies. We were in much despair.
I myself have been dualbooting since I was in Grade 8. No big deal!</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Nov 4, 2014</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>I am blogging after a week or two I guess. Well, I hadn&#8217;t promised to be a good blogger either :p.
PULUG stands for Panjab University Linux User Group. It was started by my seniors some time back. If I am correct, then maybe in 2012. KP Sir along with Nitin Sir started it. Unlike the other geeks who blabber on and on about Open Source, these guys are really (by that I mean &#8220;really&#8221;) awesome.</p></div>
