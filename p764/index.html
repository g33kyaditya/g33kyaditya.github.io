			<p>A certain someone inspired me to write this down, after so long a time. She doesn&#8217;t know about this, so hopefully she&#8217;ll not be reading it anytime soon. For lack of something good, I&#8217;ll just update y&#8217;all on my life and university (something that&#8217;s a headline for this blog)</p>

<p>I got into my last year of Engineering this semester. Contrary to my thoughts, I ended up passing all my courses from last semester. I still feel relieved saying. I&#8217;m not a very bright student after all.</p>

<p>I spent my summer in New Delhi. I was interning at <a href="https://provakil.com/">provakil</a>. It was a very fun and rewarding experience. Everyone was very chill and the whole startup environment reminded me a lot about Silicon Valley (the HBO T.V series). Provakil is an early stage SaaS startup that provide legal software and related services to lawyers. For my 2 months, I stayed in Lajpat Nagar. I was a full stack software engineering intern, although I was treated like a full time member of the team. We worked hard and partied harder. They even paid me well, so what else could a 20yo desire in an internship ? Man, it&#8217;s gonna take me another blog post if I had to write about everything that happened in Delhi during summer. But it&#8217;s a post for a different time.</p>

<p>I came back in the last week of July. College had started a week before. Typical college ghissu mates in my class too. And then began my journey of applying and interviewing to companies. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m still doing. Just after Diwali, I have a couple of interviews lined up. It&#8217;s hectic and excruciatingly tiring. I was feeling so burned out that I literally took more than a month&#8217;s break. Now that I think of it, although I did manage to get past that physical and mental burn out (since my end sems in May), I&#8217;m feeling out of practice. It&#8217;s gonna take more than a few days now to get back into form.</p>

<p>And the only thing good about this is that I&#8217;ve got a few offers. I&#8217;ve still not made up my mind on where I want to work after graduation, but I&#8217;m gonna keep trying till Jan-Feb period. There&#8217;s more juicy news, although I&#8217;d like to keep it closer to my chest until everything&#8217;s finalized.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>See you later !</p>
