                <p>So, I was going through Abhinav Badola&#8217;s Google+ profile, and found out this funny comparison between C and C++. Being a geek myself, I was compelled to post it here. So here it goes&#8230;</p>

<p>C is the crotchety old man who lives in the engine room. He is perpetually</p>

<p>tinkering, occasionally mumbling words that make no sense to anyone,</p>

<p>but might be old Norse (&#8220;scanfing vastart, strtok div frexping calloc! Err,</p>

<p>no.&#8221;). When he&#8217;s not mumbling, he&#8217;s waving his little antique pistol in the</p>

<p>air and ranting about how real men take out their own garbage. Despite</p>

<p>this, he&#8217;s a pretty chill teacher; he hands you the tools, points you in the right direction, and gets out of your way. But he&#8217;ll just sit back and cackle</p>

<p>when, as inevitably happens, you turn a wrench the wrong way and</p>

<p>scalding steam erupts into your face. C++ is the mad professor who&#8217;s had this machine for sale in SkyMall</p>

<p>catalogues for years now â€“ it takes up an entire room and provides thirty-</p>

<p>seven hundred different methods of producing delicious home-cooked</p>

<p>meals in just three minutes flat! Really, most of the people buying this</p>

<p>contraption just put it in a back room and limit their use to the juicer</p>

<p>attachment and maybe just maybe the pasta maker. But you&#8217;re sure you can do better! You buy the service manual from the professor and go to</p>

<p>figure the thing out, only to discover that the person who designed the</p>

<p>thing is none other than the crotchety old man who lives in the engine</p>

<p>room. In terms of power:</p>

<p>C is a chainsaw. C++ is a 50-foot tall earthmover that mows down everything in its path,</p>

<p>and has giant chainsaws sticking out of its wheel hubs to boot. Sure, both can clear trees out of your way, but&#8230; In terms of special:</p>

<p>C is a rockstar. C++ is a narco-syndicate collective of superheroes.</p>

<p>I hope this clarifies.</p>
